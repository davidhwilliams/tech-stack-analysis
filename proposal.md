## Unsupervised Machine Learning Proposal

#### Tech Stack Clustering and Trends Analysis for Web Applications

Cluster web apps based on their tech stack features to identify common patterns and outliers.

### Tasks

- Represent tech stacks as feature vectors (e.g., one-hot encoding or embeddings for technologies).
- Apply clustering algorithms like K-Means, DBSCAN, or Hierarchical Clustering.
- Use dimensionality reduction techniques like PCA to visualize clusters.

### Outcome

- Clear grouping of tech stack clusters (e.g., modern stacks, legacy stacks, highly specialized stacks).
- Insights into which clusters are most associated with scalability, performance, or domain-specific success.

### Potential Data Sources

- GitHub repositories (analyze package.json, requirements.txt, etc.).
- Developer surveys (e.g., Stack Overflow Developer Survey, JetBrains State of Developer Ecosystem).
- Job postings from platforms like LinkedIn or Indeed mentioning required tech stacks.

## Roadmap

1. Define Scope and Objectives

   **Objective:** Identify trends, popular combinations, and unique groupings of frontend-backend tech stacks in web development.

   **Key Questions to Answer:**

   - What are the most common tech stack pairings?
   - How do tech stack preferences differ by industry or region?
   - Are there patterns in tech stacks for high-performing projects?

2. Data Collection

   **Sources:**

   - **GitHub Repositories:**
     - Use the GitHub API to gather data from package.json, requirements.txt, Dockerfile, or other configuration files.
     - Include metadata like stars, forks, and primary language for additional insights.

3. Data Preprocessing

   **Steps:**

   - **Tech Stack Normalization:**
     - Standardize technology names (e.g., "Node.js" vs "Node").
     - Map tools to categories (e.g., React -> Frontend, Express -> Backend).
   - **Feature Engineering:**
     - One-hot encode each technology/tool.
     - Create composite features (e.g., Frontend-Backend pairs like "React-Node.js").
   - **Handle Missing or Incomplete Data:**
     - Fill gaps (e.g., if a backend is missing but "Django templates" are present, infer "Django").
     - Remove incomplete entries if necessary.
   - **Dimensionality Reduction:**
     - Use PCA or similar techniques to reduce the high-dimensional feature space if needed.

4. Unsupervised Machine Learning

   **Steps:**

   - **Clustering:**
     - Use clustering algorithms (e.g., K-Means, DBSCAN, Hierarchical Clustering) to group projects based on tech stacks.
     - Experiment with different distance metrics (e.g., Jaccard for binary data).
   - **Evaluation:**
     - Use metrics like Silhouette Score to evaluate cluster quality.
     - Visualize clusters in 2D or 3D space using t-SNE or PCA.
   - **Insights:**
     - Interpret clusters to identify trends (e.g., "Cluster 1: Modern stacks like React + Node.js", "Cluster 2: Legacy stacks like jQuery + PHP").

5. Insights and Visualizations

   **Visualizations:**

   - **Heatmaps:**
     - Show co-occurrence frequencies of frontend and backend technologies.
   - **Cluster Plots:**
     - Visualize clusters of tech stacks with annotations for popular pairings.
   - **Trend Lines:**
     - Show how the popularity of tech stacks evolves over time.

   **Deliverables:**

   - Report or dashboard summarizing findings.
   - Interactive visualizations (e.g., using Tableau, Power BI, or Plotly).

6. Implementation Tools

   **Data Collection:**

   - GitHub API.
     **Data Processing:**
   - Python with Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn.
     **Clustering & Analysis:**
   - Scikit-learn, Scipy, TensorFlow/PyTorch (if embeddings are needed).
     **Visualization:**
   - Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly.
