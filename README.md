# Web App Tech Stack Clustering and Trends Analysis

This project aims to cluster web apps based on their tech stack features to identify common patterns and outliers between frontend and backend web app frameworks.

### Tasks

- Represent tech stacks as feature vectors (e.g., one-hot encoding or embeddings for technologies).
- Apply clustering algorithms like K-Means, DBSCAN, or Hierarchical Clustering.
- Use dimensionality reduction techniques like PCA to visualize clusters.

### Outcome

- Clear grouping of tech stack clusters (e.g., modern stacks, legacy stacks, highly specialized stacks).
- Insights into which clusters are most associated with scalability, performance, or domain-specific success.

### Data Sources

- GitHub repositories via [GitHub API](https://docs.github.com/en/rest?apiVersion=2022-11-28)
